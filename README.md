# AI-Grocery-Budget-Planner
The AI Grocery Budget Planner, branded as Your Grocery Planner, is a web-based tool developed to address the challenges of grocery shopping on a budget. With rising food costs, families seek efficient ways to plan meals, reduce waste, and maximize savings without compromising nutrition. Your Grocery Planner leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized recommendations, such as budget allocations, meal plans, and shopping lists, tailored to user preferences (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or both). The application features two chatbots: a primary grocery budget assistant powered by predefined responses and the DeepSeek API, and a secondary Chatbase chatbot for additional interactions. The platform is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and accessible, catering to users in India with pricing in Indian Rupees.
